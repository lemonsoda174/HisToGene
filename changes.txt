changes for Histogene:

in dataset.py, ViT_HER2ST: change self.r from 224//4 to 224//8
in tutorial.ipynb, HistoGene training block: add patch_size = 224//4
--> A normal patch is now of size 224/4=56 and sub_patch is of size 224/8=28
, rather than in the original paper: 112 (patch) and 56 (subpatch for 4x resolution)

doing in hope of alleviating strain on GPU usage (originally required ~20GBs of RAM
, where the original paper mentions using a 32GB GPU)
